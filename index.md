title: About Me

I'm a web and software developer, and I like to turn my hand to anything in front of me. I'm a PHP Team leader at [Spindogs](https://www.spindogs.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'} and I used to be Technical Director at [Glue Digital Studio](https://gluestudio.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'}. My main focus of development is bespoke [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'} plugins, themes and anything related. Some of the things I get up to at work incude:
* Developing and delivering API integrations for PHP and WordPress sites.
* Writing well-documented object-oriented PHP code that encourages reuse by the team.
* Creating and maintaining bespoke themes and plugins for WordPress sites.
* Designing and developing bespoke API endpoints, within the WordPress REST API system.
* Maintaining and rewriting a bespoke PHP platform package for increasing our WordPress siteâ€™s stabilinotesty, security and the efficiency of our development team. 
* Developing bespoke e-commerce platforms, with integrations to third party services such as Sage
* Implementing and customising WooCommerce installations, with bespoke feature plugins, custom themes and  integrations with bespoke systems.
* Using Javascript to create dynamic pages, with content returned from API calls. 
* Working with SQL in raw queries, and using frameworks such as Eloquent and WP_Query.
* Coaching and supporting a team of developers grow their skills and meet their objectives
* Supporting Project Managers and Business Development teams for technical guidance on quoting and supporting project lifecycles. 
* Debugging and maintaining PHP projects built in many frameworks, including bespoke PHP frameworks developed in house.
* Developing systems that interact with complex data, such as data provided via third-party tools and services that run on device and output in raw formats.
* Worked with templating languages such as Twig and Blade. 
* Use of node, webpack and other front-end compilation tools.
* Creation and supporting deployment pipelines, including dependancy management and testing in the pipeline for deployment.
* Managing and supporting migrations and deployments between servers.
* Identifying and resolving technical issues relating to website performance and page-speed insights.
* Supporting the team creating and running local development environments.
* Contributing to strategy and planning decisions around infrastructure and resource management

Outside of PHP, I adore [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'}, I like [JavaScript](https://javascript.com){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'}, I love [React](https://reactjs.org){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'}.

I've recently had some fun with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'} on a private little project, and enjoy developing beautiful user expereinces.

I make this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'} ([why not wordpress?](/2021/10/30/why-not-wordpress.md)), and I've enjoyed [Shopify](https://shopify.com){:target="_blank" rel='noopener'} development in the past. 

So if you're looking for someone like me, why not [get in touch](#contact).
