title: About Me
---

I'm a web and software developer, and I like to turn my hand to anything in front of me. I used to be Technical Director at [Glue Digital Studio](https://gluestudio.co.uk){:target="_blank"}. I adore [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift){:target="_blank"}, I love [PHP](https://php.net){:target="_blank"}, I like [JavaScript](https://javascript.com){:target="_blank"}, I tolerate [React](https://reactjs.org){:target="_blank"} and I struggle with [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com){:target="_blank"}.

I've recently had some fun with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/){:target="_blank"} on a private little project, and enjoy developing beautiful user expereinces.

I make this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, and I've enjoyed [Shopify](https://shopify.com){:target="_blank"} development in the past. <br><small>(sshhhh, Shopify and Jekyll are practically the same!)</small>

So if you're looking for someone like me, why not [get in touch](#contact).
