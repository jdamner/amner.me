I'm a PHP Developer with a focus on WordPress but have experience with other frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony, and others.

I'm most comfortable writing object-oriented code in MVC frameworks. Within WordPress it's hard to write in a true MVC methodology so I make use of [Timber](https://timber.io/) to use Twig templating engine to provide seperation. For all plugins and bespoke theme development I use class and object oriented approach which makes it easy to maintain and extend.

I love creating API endpoints and RESTful APIs to be consumed by front end frameworks such as React. I also use the WordPress REST API to create my own endpoints.

I've got loads of experience with both WooCommerce and entirely bespoke ecommerce solutions written within the WordPress ecosystem. Most of my work currently focuses around integrating client sites with third party APIs or developing custom features on top of their site.
