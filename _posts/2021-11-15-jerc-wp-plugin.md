I've got a new WordPress plugin. It's a plugin to help developers find and identify javascript errors on their website. Check out more on the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/javascript-error-reporting-client).

As with most good projects, it was born of a need I had and is available open-source on [github](https://github.com/jdamner/javascript-error-reporting-client).
