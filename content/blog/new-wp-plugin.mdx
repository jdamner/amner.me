I've got a new WordPress plugin. It's a plugin to help developers find and identify javascript errors on their website. Check out more on the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/javascript-error-reporting-client).

As with most good projects, it was born of a need I had and is available open-source on [github](https://github.com/jdamner/javascript-error-reporting-client). 

You may not have noticed, but most of the internet is powered by Javascript these days. I love it, but debugging can be a pain. What's even worse is when the error only occurs on a handful of clients and you can't reproduce it. This plugin helps you find those errors.

There are some third-party services out there that do this, but for me I wanted a solution that was both privacy-first and super-simple. As with most of my projects, I wanted to be able to host it myself and not have to rely on a third-party service. I also wanted to be able to see the errors in my own format and not have to rely on a third-party service to tell me what the error is. 

This plugin does exactly that - it logs all JS errors, and creates a place you can see them in the WordPress admin. It's a simple plugin, with some simple features, but it's a great tool for any developer who wants to see what's going on with their website.
