I've just launched a new app - it's a simple utility that allows you to see the colour on your screen under the mouse cursor. Go find more at [colorbar.app](https://colorbar.app) or download at the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colorbar/id1510408002).

It's been an excellent exercise in learning Swift and about the Mac App Store. Swift was my first introduction to a truly type-safe language and I've been enjoying it immensely. It makes you realise that if you're writing `?` everywhere in your code, you're probably not doing it right, and as a result it's made my skills in other languages better. I now find myself writing more type-safe code in PHP and JavaScript (TypeScript) and I'm enjoying it.

If you've never tried a type-script language, I'd recommend starting on Swift. It's got a really shallow learning curve (at the start!) and it's a great language to learn the basics of type safety. Advanced features of strongly-typed languages are a little harder to learn, but the basics are easy to pick up and can be easily applied to other languages. Having typed code is a far safer way to write code in a way that you know what you're doing and what you're getting back from a function.

There's tons of useful tutorials out there for Swift, but I'd recommend starting with [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/). It's a great resource for learning Swift and it's free. I've also found [SwiftUI by Tutorials](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui) to be a great resource for learning SwiftUI for some other slightly more _secret_ projects I'm working on.
