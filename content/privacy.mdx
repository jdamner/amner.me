## I'm a believer that privacy is standard expectation for all digital services.

There's a few blog posts about the technical implementation of this website, but in short I build a static site I host on GitHub Pages, and DNS is handled by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). Cloudflare collects some basic analytics though I'm genuinely not sure how much there is.

If you contact me via email, I'll do everything I can to keep your personal information but I'll be holding some of your personal information in that instance. It's a personal email address that runs through Apple's iCloud service. Apple talks good game on privacy too, so I'm confident that it'll be as private as email can be. 

There's no cookies, no local storage or any other funny-business on this site. It's just a place for me to write about things I'm interested in with no ulterior motives.
