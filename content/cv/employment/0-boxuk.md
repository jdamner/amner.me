My primary role is as Tech Lead on a multi-national e-commerce (WooCommerce) site for a FTSE100 company.

As a Senior Developer I also have responsibility to deliver high quality work and to support and coach junior members of the team. I also support other project teams, and contribute to company-wide initiatives with my technical knowledge and experience. I have provided solutions for performant data processing of large data-sets to import into a WordPress context in a consistent and structured manner. During my time at BoxUK I have gained exposure working with WordPress VIP and WPEngine hosting services, along with additional experience working with AWS on serverless functions adjacent to the project.

Working on such large projects has enabled me to develop further knowledge and skills around delivering high- performance code with huge focus on techniques such as caching, and the implications of serving cached content in conjunction with personalised experiences.
