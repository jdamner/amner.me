In Spindogs I managed a team of 8 developers specialising in development of Laravel, WordPress and a number of no-framework PHP solutions for new and existing clients. My core responsibilities involved providing technical support and leadership for my team, being a point of escalation for support tickets that could not be resolved within the team, as well as providing delivery of solutions for a number of projects. I was also responsible for determining and enforcing our coding standards and quality processes to ensure consistent high standards of reusable code that’s well documented and efficient.

Within this role I also developed an object-oriented framework that works in conjunction with WordPress to help my team of developers work efficiently. The framework included often reused functionality in an extendable and configurable way, and included features such as a bespoke form-building/handling framework, a number of helper classes and functionality that handle common functions like breadcrumbs and paging effortlessly, and a solution for creating Models, Migrations and Controllers that behave like Laravel’s Eloquent ORM but integrate seamlessly with WordPress. Having this pre-built drastically improved the delivery time of bespoke builds and provided consistency for developers who often worked on multiple projects in a small time period. This package was served as a private composer dependancy to all projects.
