During my time at Glue Digital Studio I created and managed our hosting and backup infrastructure, and processes using git version control for CI/CD processes with GitHub Actions for testing and deployment. As a full-stack developer I made use of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SASS and CSS where we primarily developed bespoke plugins and themes for WordPress to meet clients needs. As our agency was fairly small I needed to be adaptable to take on any project or site so during this time I also gained experience working with Symphony, Laravel and framework-less PHP. I developed a few sites using NoSQL databases with React front-ends or static site generators such as Hugo and Jekyll. We had a few sites on the Shopify platform, where I developed bespoke themes/styles and custom functionality for subscription products with complex variability. I developed and maintained a few iOS and Android apps making use of ReactNative for cross-platform development.

Ultimately a differing opinion on how best to grow the company resulted in my decision to leave Glue Studio and return to my prior employment.
