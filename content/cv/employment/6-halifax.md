At Halifax my duties included complaint handling and coaching to prevent re-occurrence, communication skills for deep fact-finding conversation and staff management. I gained skills in Time and Diary Management to complete tasks to my own schedule, compliance within a Regulatory Environment. I used my attention to detail to a carry out compliance auditing and deliver coaching and support to the team to maintain compliance. I was also responsible for Bereavement and Power of Attorney servicing for customers in moment of truth situations. I used my technical skills developed outside of the job to become the key person in ATM servicing and fault fixing which often included a number of technical processes to resolve issues.
