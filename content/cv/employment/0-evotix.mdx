As a Senior Software Engineer at **Evotix**, I work on the backend of a headless learning and training platform, built using PHP and WordPress and consumed via a RESTful API by a React frontend. I lead on feature development, but also take ownership of influencing architectural direction, and advising on long-term technical strategy. I also maintain and extend the React-based backend interface that supports internal operations. Although I operate within a broader .NET ecosystem, I’m one of just two PHP developers in the company—giving me a unique level of autonomy and responsibility in guiding platform direction and standards.

My role involves more than just writing code. I help support team members, review contributions, and I work closely within a cross-functional team that includes product, design, and QA, contributing both technical solutions and process improvements. I routinely provide input to senior stakeholders, bridging technical decisions with wider product goals.

A growing focus of my role has been navigating the challenges of a large legacy codebase. I’ve been leading efforts to reduce technical debt, improve maintainability, and align our architecture with future needs—balancing delivery speed with longer-term platform health. This part of the role has sharpened my ability to think strategically and act as a steward for sustainable software development.
