My time in BoxUK is spent as a Tech Lead, split between a multi-national e-commerce (WooCommerce) site for a FTSE100 company and a second project for a government agency. As Tech Lead I have provided guidance on what approach we should take to meet our clients needs and designed the underlying technical infrastructure that lead to creating better solutions. I also lead open discussions with the Product Owner and Project Manager on addressing issues like technical debt, along with leading conversations with the development team on new feature delivery. I lead all our client demo sessions, demonstrating the value that we have provided during the previous sprint. 

As a Senior Developer my responsibilities also include supporting and coaching more junior members of the team, including those outside my project teams. I also contribute to company-wide initiatives with my technical knowledge and experience. During my time at BoxUK I have gained exposure working with WordPress VIP and WPEngine hosting services, along with additional experience working with AWS on serverless functions running adjacent to the projects. 

Working on such large projects has enabled me to develop further knowledge and skills for delivering high-performance code, and the implications of serving heavily cached content in conjunction with providing personalised experiences. Hosting infrastructure like WordPress VIP is also slightly different to the typical single-host environment of most WordPress hosting, and learning to write performant code and debug issues that appear only in this environment has become second nature.
