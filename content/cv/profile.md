I’ve spent the majority of my web developer career working within a WordPress context, but I have good experience working with Laravel and no-framework PHP codebases. Having experienced other frameworks helps me have an open mind to finding simple solutions to complex problems. Within WordPress, I typically use composer to manage dependancies and handle autoloading, using a base structure similar to Roots Bedrock. This helps structure the code in a safe and convenient manner.

I have extensive experience working with WooCommerce, developing bespoke payment gateways, unique product types, shipping integrations and connections, and integrations to third party services such as Sage ERP. I have developed API integrations where I’m comfortable both consuming an API or creating one to be consumed. As great as WooCommerce is, I also have experience working with a number of bespoke e-commerce solutions within a WordPress and no-framework contexts where using an off the shelf solution would not have provided the functionality needed at the performance required.

I enjoy developing using Gutenberg for static and dynamic content blocks, and have experience using templating languages such as Twig and Blade for server-side generation of front-end content too. I have worked with front- end frameworks and tools such as Bootstrap and SASS, and lots of Javascript frameworks such as jQuery and React. I have tons of experience with all the common build-tools such as webpack and gulp.

I’ve also worked with automated build, test and deployment pipelines using Travis, GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines with the appropriate tools such as Composer, NPM, PHPUnit, Jest etc. to ensure quality is maintained with each release.
