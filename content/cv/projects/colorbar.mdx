I have developed a simple utility for macOS that puts the colour under your cursor in the menubar. Itâ€™s written in Swift and I released it on the Mac App Store. I took this as an opportunity to learn Swift, which provided an excellent learning experience for a truly type-safe language. And of course the project needed a website which is a static site built using next.js and Tailwind, similar to this one.
