__[#colorBar macOS App](https://colorbar.app)__
I have developed a simple utility for macOS that puts the colour under your cursor in the menubar. It’s written in Swift and I released it on the Mac App Store. I took this as an opportunity to learn Swift, which massively improved my PHP skills it’s type-safe nature. Having released this as a product, I have gained other skills such as needing to support the product. And of course the project needed a website, which is a static site built using next.js and Tailwind, similar to this one.
