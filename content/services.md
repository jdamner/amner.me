I'm a web developer with a focus on PHP and Javascript. I've got lots of experience working both as a freelance developer and as part of an employed team.

I have an unusual background in that I started my career working in finance and moved to web development later in life. It's my passion, so I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn new things. I think my background also gives me a unique perspective on the commercial aspect of web development and how to make a site work for the client's business, and not just being in it for the tech. But I do love the tech too!
