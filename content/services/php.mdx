title: PHP

My first love was PHP with a focus on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Over the years I've gained tons of experience with other frameworks such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com).

I'm most comfortable writing [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) code, typcally producing a REST API for my javascript frontend. 
Because I usually specialise in WordPress, following a true OO pattern isn't always easy but I've found as I've developed more
bespoke and unique solutions having these skills becomes more useful.
