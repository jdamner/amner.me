title: Javascript & React
---

I've worked with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) for a number of years and find the stateful nature of the React framework to really work well in my head. I love the component based approach and the ability to create reusable components that can be used in multiple places.

This site is build using React and the [NextJS](https://www.nextjs.org/) framework. I parse [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files for the content. This site is totally open source too, so if you're curious about how it's built, you can check out the [source code](https://www.github.com/jdamner/amner.me).

Also, as a statically generated site, it's super fast and easy to deploy.
