[WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) is awesome. I've been using it for over 10 years and have built an amazing variety of sites using WordPress as the CMS and underlying structure. I've built sites for clients, built sites for myself, and built sites for fun. I build custom themes and plugins for clients and have built a [plugin](https://github.com/jdamner/javascript-error-reporting-client) that's available on the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/javascript-error-reporting-client/).

I've done headless builds using just the REST API and React, I've built sites using the [Timber](https://timber.io/) framework, and I've built sites using the [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) framework. I've built sites using the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) editor and I've built sites using the classic editor. Basically, if you need a WordPress site, I can build it.
