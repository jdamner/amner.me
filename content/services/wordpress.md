I've worked with React and React native for a few years and find the stateful nature of the React framework to be a great fit for my needs.

This site is build using React components and is built using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) framework. I've used [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query data for the site to use during it's build process.

I've built a handful of React Native apps and love the speed at which you can build a cross platform app using a single codebase.
