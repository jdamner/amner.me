Writing code and building solutions is just part of the skillset. 
When working on enterprise level applications, you'll be working as part of a team which
means you'll need leadership and solution management. 

I spend lots of my time designing the solution internally and ensuring that the
team has a good consensus on our approach, ensuring everyone has agreement on the way
we want to tackle the problem. 

Sometimes this is easy, sometimes the solution takes a little while to get together. 
It's important to plan things well so that the team can work efficiently and deliver
things right first time.
