[WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) is awesome. People say it's not good at X and not good at Y, and that's sometimes true
but the true power of WordPress is the amount of UI that's provided 'free' with the platform. Other frameworks will provide great
solutions for common requirements (ie user-auth), but nothing tends to offer a UI that is as flexible as WordPress. It's data structure
isn't what most developers want, but in truth it's very flexible to fit most solutions. 

I've been using it for over 10 years and have built an amazing variety of sites using WordPress as the CMS and underlying structure. 
I've built simple brochure sites, complex integrated sites, estate agency, learning management systems, ecommerce, even a higher-education grant and adminssions solution. 
It's always built with completely custom themes and plugins. Using off the shelf works occassionally for some needs (SEO!), but
at an enterprise level the majority of needs require bespoke solutions. At it's core WordPress is a lightweight PHP framework,
so you can build _anything_ in it, right down to completely bespoke applications that don't even realise WordPress exists.
