title: Testing

Testing is a massive part of modern software development. 
It's too easy to write bugs that can slip the net, especially considering that websites need to run on a variety of browsers and devices. 
Writing tests is just part of the flow, and really helps you understand what should (and shouldn't happen). 

The tests for this site are run using Vitest and Storybook but this is a simple site with minimal testing needs. 
In my day job, PHPUnit is the go-to solution for PHP testing.
I also love tools that complete static analysis like PHPStan and SonarQube/SonarCloud.

If you're reading this, you probably already know what CI/CD is so let's not worry too much about defining it because it's been [done](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) a thousand times. 
I've used GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Atlassian Pipelines, Travis and some roll-your-own scripts hosted on a private server.
