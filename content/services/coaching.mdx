Working within a team gives everyone a great chance to provide
feedback on what's good and what they'd do differently. 

I remember in the early days I created a pull request and another
developer left a dozen or so comments on different approaches. He
called me and asked if I was offended to which I said this was the
best feedback I'd had in a while. I also proceeded to explain some
of my decisions and we talked through and both felt like we'd learned
about each other. 

For me, providing feedback is valuable not only to the person recieving
but also to the person giving - talking through problems and solutions 
and listening to other peoples perspectives gives you a new view on
how you can solve your own problems in the future.
