title: HTML & CSS
---
HTML & CSS powers the internet. But these days, nobody writes basic HTML CSS anymore. For HTML, this is usually genated from a server-side language like PHP, or a client-side language like Javascript. For CSS we use preprocessors like SCSS and frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to make our lives easier. So all those other skills listed here are really just a way to get the right HTML & CSS generated.

This site is written using Tailwind only, there's not a lick of custom CSS here. I've used Bootstrap for years too, but find Tailwind to have a slightly better feature set than Bootstrap, especially if you're trying to avoid writing custom CSS. 

I also love CSS animations, though I'm not as great at that compared to using other animation frameworks.
