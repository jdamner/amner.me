[WooCommerce](https://www.woocommerce.com) is the eCommerce platform for WordPress, so it's kind of a default. 
But there's lots of other solutions out there, and building a bespoke eCommerce solution isn't all that hard. 

If you're using a pre-build solution like WooCommerce, or something bespoke theres always fun things to do. Things like integrating with Warehouse Management Systems, bespoke payment gateways, special shipping methods and so much more. 
WooCommerce provides so much UI for administration of a store, and one of my favourite things about WooCommerce is the extensibility
of the classes within the plugin. It's easy to extend by adding incredibly complex product-types enabling the ability to build 
anything from a simple product right up to a complex product that has incredibly complex pricing and shipping rules. 
Or even a product that's not really a product, but a subscription service granting access to digital content. And then mix and match
building a commerce system that allows users to buy _everything_ in one basket. I've even built a learning management system, using
WooCommerce to power the 'paid-for' content, that allows mixed baskets with physical goods too. Managed delegation, credit accounts, 
it's all possible!
