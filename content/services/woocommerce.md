title: WooCommerce

[WooCommerce](https://www.woocommerce.com) is the eCommerce platform for WordPress. I've built a number of sites using WooCommerce and extended it to do some pretty cool things. Things like integrating with Warehouse Management Systems, bespoke payment gateways, special shipping methods and so much more. 

One of my favourite things about WooCommerce is the structure of the classes within the plugin. It's easy to extend by adding incredibly complex product-types enabling the ability to build anything from a simple product right up to a complex product that has incredibly complex pricing and shipping rules. Or even a product that's not really a product, but a subscription service granting access to digital content.
