title: React
---

I love working with [React](https://reactjs.org) and find the stateful and reactive nature of the framework to really work well in my head. 
I love the composable based approach and the ability to create reusable components that can be used in multiple places, and using state 
management systems like Redux to help manage API responses and shared application state. 

This site is build using some form of React (currently a simple [Vite](https://vite.dev) setup) but I've used [NextJS](https://www.nextjs.org/) and many other frameworks over the years. 
I parse [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files for the content, because markdown just makes sense. 
This site is open source too, so if you're curious about how it's built, you can check out the [source code](https://www.github.com/jdamner/amner.me).

Also, as a statically generated site, it's super fast and easy to deploy which suits me!
