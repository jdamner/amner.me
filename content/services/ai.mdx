title: AI

Who's a developer who doesn't put AI on their skill list these days. But what does AI mean as a skill? 

I've been using AI code assistants and chatbots for a good few years now - I _really_ enjoy the way they takes some of the tedious 
work away from me. Manually writing long `switch` statements is a thing of the past. They're also such a great
tool to quickly prototype an idea, or test a proof of concept to make sure you're not starting off in the wrong
direction. 

AI is also an always present [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), and is usually
pretty decent at code-reviews. It's like that nerd who goes off and reads the documentation for every API call
and _well actually_'s you to say that the API _can_ return this strange edge case you didn't notice. 

Where it's less good is large projects, and working at enterprise level means you often spend more time explaining
the product than getting answers. 

I also have had tons of fun experminenting with AI solutions, from applying custom training to models and using
AI chaining and tools to build responses that are much more useful than simple text. The true power of AI in
enterprise applications is yet to be realised and it's more of a design problem than a technical one. How to 
give a user the interface to such a diverse and wide solution is a challenge I'm curious to see how it goes.
