title: Gutenberg

Gutenberg is the new editor for WordPress. I think it's going to be a game changer for WordPress and I'm really looking forward to seeing what people do with it. The future looks like Gutenberg is spreading it's wings beyond WordPresss too and I'm really excited to see what happens.

Because of my experience with React, I'm comfortable putting together any components needed for site generation. Creating an interface for site administrators to create content is really important to decentralise the process of creating content and I think Gutenberg is going to be a big part of that.
