title: PHP

I'm a PHP Developer with a focus on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) but have experience with other frameworks such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Symfony](https://symfony.com), and others.

I'm most comfortable writing [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) code in [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) frameworks. Because I usually specialise in WordPress, it can be hard to write in a true MVC methodology. I've found that the [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) framework is a great way to get a WordPress site up and running in a more MVC style.

I love creating API endpoints and RESTful APIs to be consumed by front end frameworks such as React and this is my preferred way of building sites these days.
